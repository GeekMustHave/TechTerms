== Terms

=== Data Lake

A data lake is a storage repository that holds a vast amount of raw data in its native format until it is needed. While a hierarchical data warehouse stores data in files or folders, a data lake uses a flat architecture to store data.

Any large data pool in which the schema and data requirements are not defined until the data is queried.

The term data lake is often associated with Hadoop-oriented object storage.

=== Slowly Changing Dimensions

Very simply, there are 6 types of Slowly Changing Dimension that are commonly used, they are as follows:

* Type 0 – Fixed Dimension
No changes allowed, dimension never changes
* Type 1 – No History
Update record directly, there is no record of historical values, only current state
* Type 2 – Row Versioning
Track changes as version records with current flag & active dates and other metadata
* Type 3 – Previous Value column
Track change to a specific attribute, add a column to show the previous value, which is updated as further changes occur
* Type 4 – History Table
Show current value in dimension table but track all changes in separate table
* Type 6 – Hybrid SCD
Utilise techniques from SCD Types 1, 2 and 3 to track change
* Type 7 - see <<Type 1 and 2 Dimension>>

=== Type 1 and 2 Dimensions

A fact table can be accessed through  a dimension modeled both as a `type 1` dimension showing only the most current  attribute values, 
or as a `type 2` dimension showing correct contemporary  historical proﬁles. 
The same dimension table enables both perspectives. 
Both the durable key and primary surrogate key of the dimension are placed in the fact table. 

For the `type 1` perspective, the current ﬂag in the dimension is checked to be current,  
and the fact table is joined via the `durable key`. For the `type 2` perspective, 
the current ﬂag is not checked, and the fact table is joined via the `surrogate primary key`. 
These two perspectives would be deployed as separate views to the BI applications.
